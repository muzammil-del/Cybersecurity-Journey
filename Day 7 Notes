Day 7: Network Exploitation & Metasploit Fundamentals 🔓

Today's Penetration Testing Journey:
✅ Metasploit framework installation and navigation
✅ Vulnerable lab environment setup (Metasploitable)
✅ First successful exploitation: vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor
✅ Meterpreter payload basics
✅ Python exploit checker script development

Key Insight: Exploitation isn't about "hacking" - it's about understanding how systems fail and proving those failures exist. Every exploit learned is a defense mechanism understood.

Tools Expanded: Metasploit, Meterpreter, Custom Python scanners.
